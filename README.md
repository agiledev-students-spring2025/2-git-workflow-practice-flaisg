What is interesting is the methods they used to get chatGPT a similar performance for essentially a far less cost than what OpenAI tried to do. They used a distillation method which is different from OpenAI. This shortens the difference between the models with the creation of the R1 model from deepSeek. There is an argument of deep seek stealing OpenAI. But rather than stealing, I believe that the term building upon is more accurate. In the real world there will always be competitors trying to out compete you no matter what. In this case, Deepseek is trying to outcompete in price for essentially the same product. In the future, there will be a rise to more AI companies (there already are) and before the release of true AGI (Artifical General Intelligence), there will most likely be a competition for customers on who can have a lower cost for the customer for essentially the same LLM model.
